<p> A simple slow-growing plant that typically forms a low crusty, leaflike, or branching growth on rocks, walls, and trees. Typically, a lichen is an organism that results from a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism. </p>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>		
<p>In our case, Lichen is a collective representing artists, activists, and scientists. It is our goal to create a platform that connects individuals excited about art and architecture, social justice, the environment, science, and everything in between in interdisciplinary, symbiotic, and challenging ways. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, Lichen was born out of the aspiration to create something—something bigger than anything we could accomplish individually. We talked, and Saturday morning pipe dreams quickly became action plans and whispers of <em>we could really do this thing</em>. It seemed so obvious: create a platform where we would want to display and publish our own work, focused on topics that we think are interesting and important. 
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that regard, Lichen is incredibly personal. Yet, what we are attempting to create is fundamentally reliant on community. If you dig this idea, we would love for you to stick around.
